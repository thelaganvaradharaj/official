## üìú About The Project

This portfolio is more than just a resume; it's a dynamic and interactive presentation of my capabilities as an innovator, designer, and developer. I wanted to create a modern, responsive, and engaging user experience that reflects my passion for clean design and cutting-edge technology. The website is structured into several key sections: Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and a functional Contact form.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Homepage:** A `Typed.js` animation introduces my professional roles, complemented by a custom animated cursor and a glowing profile image effect.
- **Engaging 'About Me' Page:** Features a subtle parallax effect on the profile image and an animated RGB gradient for key text, adding a touch of dynamism.
- **Dynamic Skills Showcase:** Utilizes infinite scrolling marquees to display both technical and non-technical skills, complete with logos for immediate visual recognition.
- **Project Carousel:** An auto-scrolling horizontal carousel on desktop (which pauses on hover) and a touch-friendly swipe/drag interface on mobile.
- **Functional Contact Form:** Integrated with **EmailJS** to send messages directly to my inbox without requiring a backend server.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to smartphones, featuring a custom hamburger menu for navigation.
- **Custom Cursor:** A unique dot-and-outline cursor for desktop users that provides visual feedback when interacting with links and clickable elements.

## üé® Design & Development Process

The creation of this portfolio was a comprehensive process that combined structured design with modern development techniques.

1.  **Design in Figma:** The entire user interface and experience were first designed in **Figma**. This crucial first step allowed me to establish a cohesive visual identity, experiment with layouts, define the color palette, and prototype the user flow before writing a single line of code.

2.  **AI-Assisted Development:** To accelerate the development process, I utilized **Gemini AI** as a coding assistant. It was instrumental in generating boilerplate code, exploring different implementation approaches for complex animations, and quickly drafting the initial structure of the HTML and CSS.

3.  **Debugging and Refinement:** Using AI was a starting point, not the final step. The process involved significant **debugging, custom modifications, and manual refinement** to ensure the final product was not only functional but also perfectly aligned with my original Figma designs. I dedicated considerable time to resolving cross-browser compatibility issues, optimizing animations for performance, and perfecting the responsive layout. This hands-on approach was crucial in transforming the generated code into a polished, professional, and personal final product.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/thelaganvaradharaj/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/thelaganvaradharaj/official.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd official
    ```
